# AI-Powered Transportation Assistant (AIPTA) - Real-Time Traffic Prediction and Route Optimization

## Overview

The AI-Powered Transportation Assistant (AIPTA) is a project designed to leverage the capabilities of large language models and machine learning to provide real-time traffic predictions and route optimization. This document outlines the initial implementation phase of this feature, detailing the components involved and how they work together to achieve the desired functionality.

## Key Components

### 1. Traffic Simulation
A component that generates simulated traffic data used for model training. This simulation includes variables such as time of day and weather conditions to create realistic traffic scenarios. The data consists of time slots and weather conditions paired with corresponding levels of traffic congestion.

### 2. Machine Learning Model
A simple predictive model is employed to forecast congestion levels. A linear regression algorithm is used alongside one-hot encoding to process categorical weather information. This model takes simulated data as input, enabling it to predict traffic congestion based on time and weather inputs.

### 3. API Development
A Flask-based web service is developed to expose an endpoint that allows users to submit current traffic conditions and request route optimization. This service processes incoming requests and returns suggested routes along with predicted congestion levels.

### 4. Route Optimization
Utilizing real-time data inputs, the system determines whether specific routes, such as highways, should be taken or avoided based on predicted congestion levels. This basic functionality sets the stage for more sophisticated algorithms and real-world data integration in future phases.

## Project Setup

The project is set up in a Python environment and involves three main scripts:

- **traffic_simulation.py:** Handles data simulation tasks.
- **model.py:** Contains the implementation of the traffic prediction model.
- **app.py:** Develops the Flask application to serve the machine learning model as an API.

## Installation and Running

The project relies on several Python packages including Flask for web services and `scikit-learn` for machine learning. It's configured to run on Python with dependencies outlined in a `requirements.txt` file.

- **Flask**: Facilitates API development.
- **scikit-learn**: Used for implementing the linear regression model.
- **numpy**: Provides support for mathematical operations and transformations.

To run the project:
1. Set up a Python environment.
2. Install required packages using the command: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Execute the `app.py` script to start the Flask server (`python app.py`).

## Future Enhancements

This basic implementation uses simulated data and simple modeling techniques as proof of concept. Future development steps include:

- Integrating with real-time data sources for accurate traffic predictions.
- Enhancing the model using advanced machine learning techniques and larger datasets.
- Extending the capabilities to support multi-modal transportation planning and optimization.

This high-level overview is intended to provide a foundational understanding of the AIPTA's traffic prediction and route optimization feature, highlighting its primary components and implementation approach.
